## Please note
* This extension is intended for real users who come to chat without destructive / hostile intentions.  
* **There is a related project: [videochatru-mitm](https://github.com/qrlk/videochatru-mitm).**
  * A desktop application designed for content creators and streamers.
  * The active development of the project was stopped due to the reasons specified in its readme.
  * The use of the program may cause ethical / legal problems, so the program is provided exclusively for educational purposes.
  * To work, it requires **[obs-studio](https://obsproject.com)** and **[voicemeeter potato](https://vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/potato.htm)**.
  * The project is not intended for a wide audience and requires serious computer experience to set up and use.
* All PRs with functionality that can harm users of the platform, such as bypassing the ban on virtual cameras to scare people with screamers, will be rejected.
## What is Chat Roulette?
**By 'Chat Roulette' I mean a global platform consisting of mobile apps and many websites sharing the same userbase.**

The goal of the 'platform' is to allow users to find a random interlocutor at the touch of a button.  

The connection between users is established directly through webrtc, while the service takes over the functions of a moderator and earns money with paid unbans.

**The mobile part of the 'platform' includes:**
* [**Чат Рулетка**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chat.ruletka) (10M+ users)
* [**Ome.tv**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=omegle.tv) (50M+ users)
* [**Minichat**](https://apps.apple.com/ua/app/minichat-video-chat-texting/id1506912979)

**Web part of the 'platform' includes ~30 sites:**

* **https://ome.tv**
* **https://videochatru.com**
* **https://chatruletka.com**
* **https://ruletka.chat**
* **https://chatalternative.com**
* **https://chat-de.com**
* **https://chat-pt.com**
* **https://videochatnl.com**
* **https://ruletaespanol.com**
* **https://videochatpl.com**
* **https://videochatuk.com**
* **https://chat-brasil.com**
* Less popular intances with similar design.

## Contribution
If you have a desire to contribute, here is a small instruction.  


### some ideas:
* Usage statistics: time spent in conversations, the number of automatic skips, and so on.
* Optionally add interlocutors to the permanent/temporary blacklist by IP.
* Integration of the facial recognition API, services such as findclone.ru.
* Switch from 2gis to openstreetmap for more map coverage.
* Button to clear cookies on ban popup.
* Avoid fingerprinting.

This project will be developed under the MIT license as soon as the dependency on 2gis is removed.
